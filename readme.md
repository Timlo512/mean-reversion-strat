# Mean Reversion Strategy

This repository is designed to execute, backtest, forward test, and analyze a mean reversion strategy. It also aims to implement common mean reversion techniques.

## Strategies

### 1. Nasdaq Mean Reversion Strategy
The first strategy focuses on implementing a mean reversion strategy for Nasdaq stocks. This involves identifying overbought or oversold conditions and executing trades based on statistical mean reversion principles.

#### Data Collection for Backtest

To perform backtesting, I will collect minute-level data for the Nasdaq index, TQQQ, and SQQQ. This data will serve as the foundation for analyzing market conditions, identifying mean reversion opportunities, and testing the strategy's performance under historical scenarios.
